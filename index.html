The Aspen lower elementary students worked together to handcraft the paper used in this project! Once complete, their paper was passed off to Red Cedar.

Finally, the collection of hearts was set in a stunning floating glass frame.

                <p>
                    The Madrona and Western Hemlock classes have come together to produce three extraordinary home furnishing pieces! Inspired by recycled textiles, the first piece is a hanging tapestry, created from donated old clothing, which were cut in strips and then woven into a beautiful pattern by the children. The second piece is a sofa table, with a one-of-a-kind inset created from the children’s found natural objects, set in a soothing, ombre pattern. An ottoman adorned with a unique needlework pattern completed by the children round out this jaw-dropping entryway collection!
